Bleed and Breed Art. We are where art starts, but that’s only the beginning. We are the movement for the liberation of creative expression. We believe that art is for everyone, and we’re creating the cultural context for how it is created, discovered, and shared. Founded in August 2000, DeviantArt is the largest online social network for artists and art enthusiasts, and a platform for emerging and established artists to exhibit, promote, and share their works with an enthusiastic, art-centric community. We have over 44 million registered members and attract over 45 million unique visitors per month. Our members—known as deviants—upload tens of thousands of original pieces of art every day, ranging from painting and sculpture to digital art, pixel art, films, and anime. Artists love us because we are an inclusive and supportive community. We help them find their identity through self-expression. We provide the tools, resources, and exposure to enable them to become better, more successful artists. We inspire people to create art by feeding their creativity. We can’t help it—it runs through our veins and compels us to nurture it in others. This is DeviantArt.

Our enterprise-first, tax-status agnostic approach allows the foundation to seek investment opportunities in both nonprofit and for-profit enterprises that increase and maintain reliable employment, advance innovations that help low income communities and workers be economically resilient, and contribute to society in a way that leaves everyone better off.

Airfree provides Air Travel Industry with a SaaS solution specialized in inflight eShopping. Airfree has developed an e/m-commerce platform to transform the in-flight shopping experience, with shopping carts and paper catalogs, through digital. Passengers access thousands of product references online, order during flight time from their seat screen or smartphone, and then get delivery at the airport, at home or on board a future flight (connecting or returning flight). The Airfree team has designed and patented a semi-embedded technology that allows the hosting of updated content on the plane's servers before each flight. This allows airlines to reduce satellite connection costs; and optimizing bandwidth usage (100 times less than a ground-based website) during flight time through limited online browsing (only during the checkout phase), ensures a fast, smooth and seamless experience for passengers.

The U.S. Department of State is focused on accomplishing America's mission of diplomacy at home and around the world. The U.S. Department of State manages America’s relationships with foreign governments, international organizations, and the people of other countries. U.S. diplomats and Civil Service professionals carry out the President’s foreign policy and help build a more free, prosperous, and secure world. U.S. Department of State employees, with their skills, character and commitment to public service, are the backbone of America's diplomacy. They represent the people and advocate the interests of the U.S. to the rest of the world. The Foreign Service (FS) is dedicated to representing America and responding to the needs of American citizens in other countries. Members of the Foreign Service can be sent to any embassy, consulate, or other diplomatic mission anywhere in the world, at any time, to serve the diplomatic needs of the United States. Civil Service (CS) employees provide in-depth expertise and continuity in accomplishing all aspects of the Department's mission and are involved in virtually every function of the Department. Civil Service employees issue passports, compile and analyze overseas reports, provide logistical support to posts, consult with Congress about foreign policy initiatives and policies, and formulate and manage the budget. Nearly 7,400 Civil Service (CS) employees serve as a stable resource pool in Washington D.C., at Passport Agencies and field offices throughout the United States, and at several Consulates in Mexico. More than 31,000 Foreign Service National (FSN) employees also supplement the personnel requirements of the Department overseas. FSN employees are local residents of the countries in which we maintain diplomatic posts and consulates. They are valued members of our embassy teams, for they provide continuity for the transient American staff and have language and cultural expertise.

CDO, CMO, and CIO's depend on us to speed up Digital Transformation in a modern way. 90% of Iterate's revenue comes from our patented drag-n-drop, low-code AI app platform -- named Interplay. $1 billion to $60 billion enterprises use Interplay because it facilitates 17x faster prototyping of digital, AI, and IoT solutions. More importantly, it also scales those digital apps straight into production, whether on the Web or even on the Edge. Today, Interplay processes AI on Edge Computers in more than 3,000 locations. Nvidia, Google Cloud, and AWS are formal partners. AI and Digital software development are extremely fast because Interplay's engineers have prebuilt 475 software components; 43 of the 475 are AI enablers like Random Forest Classifiers. Interplay also includes >3,500 reusable components available from the dev community. Interplay is supported by a second proprietary product named Signals. Signals help executives make informed decisions, build digital solution roadmaps and architectures, and ensure Interplay's pre-built components are always best-of-breed. It uses AI to monitor 16 million startups, 104 million patents, and 100s of emerging trends. Large clients from diverse industries impacted by AI and IoT (financial services, retail, healthcare, education, telecom, luxury, hospitality, CPG, etc.) partner with Iterate.ai. We grew to more than $10 million in revenue on an $82,000 per month marketing budget (2021's budget) without a salesperson. To that point, all of our business came from word-of-mouth referrals.

The Commonwealth of Virginia is located in the South Atlantic region of the United States. It was the 10th state to be admitted to the Union on June 25, 1788. Home to approximately 8 million residents, Virginia is the 12th most populous state in the United States. The capital is Richmond, and its most populous city is Virginia Beach. The narrative history of the Commonwealth of Virginia often begins with the founding of Jamestown in 1607, near what is now modern day Williamsburg, Virginia. Jamestown became the first permanent English settlement in the New World, and the Virginia General Assembly, established on July 30, 1619, is now recognized as the oldest legislative body in the western hemisphere. When Virginia became a royal colony in 1624, the robust tobacco trade that had been developing in Virginia helped establish the American colonies as a powerful economic force. During the American Revolution, Virginia witnessed the final surrender of British forces at Yorktown and later became known as the birthplace of many revolution-era figures and future American presidents, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. To date, 8 United States presidents have been born in Virginia, more than in any other state. The modern government of Virginia is nearly identical in structure to the federal government, and is divided into 3 branches, these being the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. The Virginia General Assembly is comprised of the 100-member House of Delegates and the 40-member Senate. A governor and lieutenant governor are elected every 4 years. Governors cannot be elected to or serve consecutive terms. Virginia’s judicial system consists of the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the Circuit Courts, and the lower General District Courts and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts. Virginia has 13 electoral votes in presidential elections, and possesses 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Sri Lankan family tea company Dilmah, founded by Merrill J. Fernando, today the world's most experienced teamaker, has championed quality, authenticity and variety in tea. Dilmah pioneered the concept of Single Origin Tea in 1988 when the family company went against industry trends to declare its commitment to authenticity. Garden fresh, unblended tea is a hallmark of Dilmah and offers a unique taste of unblended Ceylon tea packed at source - where it is grown. Dilmah takes the lead in bringing innovation to a global tea category that has suffered decline as a result of commoditisation. Signature events such as the Chefs & the Teamaker and Real High Tea are innovations that seek to educate and inspire hospitality professionals to offer their guests a completely new tea experience. The Dilmah School of Tea seeks to inspire passion in tea through knowledge of the artisanal aspects of tea amongst hospitality professionals, tea aficionados and consumers. The emphasis is on the importance of Real Tea and the versatility of this natural herb in Tea Gastronomy, food pairing and Tea Mixology. Dilmah is Ethical Tea, in that all packaging profits are retained in Sri Lanka and fund the MJF Charitable Foundation and Dilmah Conservation. We believe that Business is a Matter of Human Service.

EAT is an international foundation linking food, health and sustainable development across science, business and policy. Originally launched in 2013, EAT is now an independent foundation with three core partners: The Stordalen Foundation, the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Wellcome Trust. The overall objective of EAT is to expand scientific knowledge on the interconnections between food, health and environmental sustainability, spur innovation along the food value chain, and facilitate the development of evidence-based policies to radically transform the global food system to be able to deliver healthy, affordable diets to a growing world population within the planetary boundaries. Multi-stakeholder, multidisciplinary and multi-scale collaboration between business, science, politics and civil society lies at the heart of EAT’s work. EAT believes that a transformation of the food system is only possible if these diverse actors collectively address the intertwined issues of food, health and sustainability, and develop integrated strategies on food production and consumption to leverage multiple benefits for human and planetary health.

The American Board of Surgery is an independent, nonprofit organization founded in 1937 for the purpose of certifying individuals who have met a defined standard of education, training and knowledge in the field of surgery. Surgeons certified by the ABS have completed at least five years of training following medical school and successfully completed a written and oral examination process administered by the ABS. They must then maintain their board certification through ongoing learning and assessment activities. Not all surgeons are board certified. Board certification by the ABS is a voluntary process that demonstrates a surgeon's commitment to lifelong learning and quality patient care. It recognizes individuals who have met ABS standards specifically in the area of general surgery and its related specialties. This is different from possessing a medical license, which is the minimum required by law to practice medicine and is not specialty specific. The ABS offers board certification in general surgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, and complex general surgical oncology. It is one of the 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.
